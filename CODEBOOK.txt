CODE BOOK

There has been little changes from the original data sets variable names.
Both files ("HAR.csv" and "Average_HAR.csv") consist of 66 numeric variables,
and two variables defining Subject and Activity for each measure. The "HAR.csv"
contains one more variable, Type.

#############################
Variable definitions: Factors

- Type: Describes if the observation comes from the test or training data sets.
Factor with two (2) levels: 
1. Test
2. Train

- Activity: Describes the type of activity realized by the subject for each observation. Factor with six (6) levels:
1. LAYING
2. SITTING
3. STANDING
4. WALKING
5. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
6. WALKING_UPSTAIRS

#############################
Variable definitions: Numeric variables

The name for each variable is formed by three (3) or two (2) terms, separated by an underscore ("_").

* First term: Describes the summary statistic for the variable
1. "mean" for the average or 
2. "std" for the standard deviation

* Second term: Describes the variable. If the variable name is preceded by "t" it means that the variable refers to a time (s). If the variable name is preceded by an "f" it means that the variable refers to a frecuency (Hz).

* Third term: Describes the axis (X, Y or Z) of the measure.
